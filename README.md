Brain Tumor Segmentation with U-Net
This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for brain tumor segmentation from MRI images using the U-Net deep learning architecture. It leverages TensorFlow and Keras to train, validate, and test a model that can automatically detect and segment tumor regions in brain MRIs.
